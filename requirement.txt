To run this, you need the following modules :
os, math, glob, cv2, deque, numpy, matplotlib, moviepy, time, sklearn, skimage, scipy
pickle

If you have these on your system, than you are ready to run the code.

also, download the dataset from below link :
	link for testing video : shorturl.at/rvDHM
	link for images : http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html

	this has images to train svc, and video for test.

to run the program : python3 main.py


Some Tips and Tricks

    If you are stuck with long processing time while running pipeline on video, please try reducing windows first.
    If you are still stuck with long processing time try reducing the number of features extracted.
    If you have a test set of say 10,000 images and your feature size is 8000, SVM will not perform upto the mark even if the accuracy on the test set is above 95%. Use SVM with ‘rbf’ kernel or reduce features.
    If it still takes long time for the pipeline to run, try skipping one half or two thirds of the frames. It will speed up. Remember by skipping frames I mean skipping the processing of frames and setting the refined windows of that frame to rectangles gathered from previous 15 frames stored in some data structure.
